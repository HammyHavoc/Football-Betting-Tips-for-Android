**Q for Android** is a demo theme for mobile apps and Progressive Web Apps (PWA) built with WP-AppKit, a WordPress plugin to create mobile apps connected to WordPress (more on that at http://getwpappkit.com).

**It is installed by default with the WP-AppKit plugin. However, you will be able to download a fresh installation from this repository**

# Installation

* Download WP-AppKit: [https://github.com/uncatcrea/wp-appkit/releases](https://github.com/uncatcrea/wp-appkit/releases)
* Install WP-AppKit as you would do for any other WordPress plugins (ie. drop the plugin folder in */wp-content/plugins*)
* Activate WP-AppKit using the _Plugins_ WordPress admin panel. (Browse the *Installed Plugins* list and click the *Activate* link of WP-AppKit.)
* Now you should have a brand new */wp-content/themes-wp-appkit* folder (yes, this is where app themes are stored)
* Download the Q for Android from [this repository](https://github.com/uncatcrea/q-android/releases) and drop its folder in */wp-content/themes-wp-appkit*
* Don't forget to rename the theme's folder if *Q for Android* is already installed.
* In WordPress, use the *WP-AppKit* admin panel to create a new app and choose one of the themes in the *Appearance* box
* From there you're free to test in your browser (using the Chrome's Emulation Mode) or directly try to compile

# Theme's Overview

## What's implemented
At the moment, Q for Android theme implements:
* A shiny material design UI (including transitions and ripple effect)
* Off-canvas menu (you can update it in the app's edit panel)
* Archive template (eg. post list) with infinite post list
* Single template (eg. a post) with the most common HTML elements (eg. strong, em, blockquote...)
* Responsive embeds
* The refresh process
* Offline cache (meaning that you can read loaded posts offline)
* Post thumbnail captions and subhead support
* A responsive interface
* Favorites support

## Android UI
* Ripple effect
* Status bar color matches the theme
* Android spinner

## Cordova Plugins
Q for Android relies on Cordova plugins to:
* Open external links in default browser (ie. Chrome): [https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-inappbrowser](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-inappbrowser)

WP-AppKit export function adds these plugins automatically to your *config.xml* file. If you don't use the export, make sure to add them in order the theme to be able to work properly.

## Responsive Images
Q for Android hooks into the WP-AppKit web services to modify the source code of images in the post content. It eases the way to style the responsive images later. See *prepare-content.php* in the *php* folder of the themes.

## Thumbnail Captions and Subheads
Q for Android hooks into the WP-AppKit web services to modify add thumbnail captions and subheads (if available) in the post content. See *add-custom-data.php* in the *php* folder of the themes. Note that subheads are expected as a post custom field.

## Compatibility with WP-AppKit add-ons:
Q for Android is compatible with all WP-AppKit add-ons:
* WP-AppKit Offline Favorites
* OneSignal for WP-AppKit
* PushWoosh for WP-AppKit
* Google Analytics for WP-AppKit
